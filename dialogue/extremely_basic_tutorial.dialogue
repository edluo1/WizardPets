Wiz: Looks like I have to do this again.
Wiz: I gotta get moving again, I can't stay in this dingy place forever. 
Wiz: OK I can still use my legs using WASD or the arrow keys that's good
Wiz: In order to use stuff in my inventory, I can click on them and then press space to place stuff on the ground
Wiz: When I'm ready to go I'll click on the teleport area and it'll let me choose where to go.
